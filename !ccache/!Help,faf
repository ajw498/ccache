<h1>ccache 1.4</h1>
<h2>RISC OS port, version 1.00</h2>


<p>
ccache is a compiler cache. It speeds up re-compilation of C/C++ code
by caching previous compiles and detecting when the same compile is
being done again.
<p>
This file only decribes things specific to RISC OS. For other details,
please see the <a href="ccache-man">ccache man page</a>
(but ignore the section about installing).
<p>
ccache as supplied only works with gcc, but should work with any C/C++
compiler that is linked with UnixLib. It does not work with Norcroft,
although if there is sufficient demand I may add support for it.
<p>
To use, just run !ccache. This will set up an alias so that all calls
to gcc call ccache instead. Then use gcc as you would normally.
<p>
By default, the cache is stored in !Scrap, but you can change this if
you wish by editing the !Run file.
<p>
The cache can be maintained by calling ccache from the command line. The
options available are detailed in the <a href="ccache-man">ccache man page</a>.
<p>
<h6>Limitations:</h6>
Throwback does not occur on a cache hit.
